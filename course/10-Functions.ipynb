    "Say you wrote some code that starts to get quite long. At some point in your program you will have to implement similar, if not identical, functionalities. Writing duplicate code is not efficient at all and will give you a lot of headache. As soon as you change that code in one place, you need to rememeber to change it also at all other places. This is prone to many errors, and no one wants errors. This is just one of the many principles in programming and it's called **DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself**!\n",

    "For this, we have functions. Functions are blocks of organised code that relate to a single common action. You can think of a function like a little robot, that has a very clear goal and can achieve that goal whenever you tell it to. This little robot, which has also a name, lives in its own isolated world, unless you share some objects with it. When the robot is done, it can give you something back (maybe a nice gift), but doesn't need to! \n",

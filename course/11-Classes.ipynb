    "Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. As the name can hint, OOP is a conceptual model that focuses on structuring your software with objects in a particular way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind, here we will only scratch the basics of object-oriented programming and we will focus on how to get up to speed quickly so you get the feeling for organising your code in a clean way rather than trying to learn all the abstract concepts! Python's class mecanism is not difficult because it adds very little new syntax and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson we have seen that a function defines some logic and this logic is only executed when we call the function! The first step was to define the function, then we can use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A class is also like a definition. A class defines the characteristics of any object of this class. By characteristics we actually mean attributes and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we would have a class defining a human. This class would hold attributes such as height, weight, age, gender, name and methods or functions such as eat(), sleep(), walk() or run().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "With a class, we can create objects of this class. Those objects are called instances! \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you have a class human, each one of us is an instance of the human class. We all share the same class or type, but all have different values for each attributes.\n",

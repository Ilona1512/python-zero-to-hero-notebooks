    "# Function Practice 1 : Parsing Daily Activities\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we want to achieve. We have a file containing information about our daily activities and we would like to take that information and extract useful knowledge from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the file. We will use a CSV (**C**omma-**S**eparated **V**alues) file. A CSV file a simple format to store data into a table-like structure. Each row has mutliple values which are separated via a comma, hence the name *comma-separated values*. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    value01,value02,value03\n",
    "    value11,value12,value13\n",
    "    value21,value22,value23\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, you will se that the first line is the column header:\n",
    "\n",
    "    header1,header2,header3\n",
    "    value01,value02,value03\n",
    "    value11,value12,value13\n",
    "    value21,value22,value23\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are not forced to separate a CSV file with commas. Often a semi-colon is used because it allows for example to use the comma in values for decimal or sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "All right. For our daily activities we will have one CSV file per day and each CSV file will have the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **activity**: The name of the activity.\n",
    "- **start_time**: The time at which the activity started (format is e.g. 14:05).\n",
    "- **duration**: The duration in hours that the activity lasted.\n",
    "- **is_outdoor**: A flag that says if the activity happened outdoor or indoor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough explanation for now, let's start to write a little code. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Reading the CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing we want to do is: read our CSV files located in `data/`. [How do we do that?](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+read+csv+file)\n"
